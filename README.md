## Mandelbrot Fractal Viewer

This applet enables you to explore the infinitely generating visuals of the Mandelbrot fractal. By clicking, dragging, then releasing (no selection box will appear, but the program retains the start and end points) you can inifnitely zoom into any region on the fractal (the view will refresh after a few seconds of recalculation).

No matter the depth you zoom to, the crystal clarity of the fractal's detail will be retained since the program recalculates the diveregence of each point within the region of the complex plane to a certain level of significant figures. Coloring of the fractal is determined on a scale from black to white depending on the amount of iterations of the equation each point on the complex plane takes to start to trend towards infinity. Black means the point never escapes to infinity, while white points escape very rapidly (usually the first iteration).
